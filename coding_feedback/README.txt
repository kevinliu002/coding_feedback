Getting Started:
This project is created in the directory ./src/com/company. To run the project, you may use any IDE and simply run main.
You may also use the associated JAVA/JAVAC commands to run main.java.

This project takes a receipt and prints out the sales tax, total price, and individual price of each
item. This project assumes that the only items exempt from sales tax are books (containing the string "book").
food (containing the string "chocolate"), and medicine (containing the string "pill"). All items that
are imported (containing the string "imported") are subjected to import duty. The import duty and sales tax
are 5% and 10% respectively.

File Structure:
This project assumes that all relevant input files are of the format .txt and have the following pattern:
{Quantity}{Product name} at {Price}. All relevant input files must be stored in the input directory located
at ./src/com/company/input
